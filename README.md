# Graph Visualization

This project was carried out as part of studies at UKSW (Cardinal Stefan Wyszy≈Ñski University in Warsaw)
within the course Individual Programming Project. Selected excerpts from the documentation are presented below.

## Introduction

The goal of the project is to create a desktop application that allows the user to visually create directed graphs
and check whether they contain a Eulerian cycle, Eulerian path, Hamiltonian cycle, Hamiltonian path, and find the shortest path
(containing the fewest edges) between points.

You can run the web app version [here](https://krawieck.github.io/graphstuff/).

You can read the official documentation PDF [here](https://github.com/krawieck/graphstuff/blob/main/docs/Projekt%20Programistyczny%20Indywidualny.pdf) (in Polish).

## Technologies

The program was created using the following web technologies:

* written in **TypeScript**
* user interface designed using **React**
* graphs visualized using **Konva** library
* styles applied using **Tailwind.css**
* build tool of choice was **Vite**
* state management library was **zustand**
* unit tests written using **vitest**

The program was then converted into a desktop application using the **Tauri** framework.
Target platforms are macOS and Windows.
